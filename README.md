# WinRAR Key File Generator In Pure JS
## 1. What are WinRAR and WinRAR Key File Generator?

**WinRAR** is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. WinRAR is not a free software. If you want to use it, you should go to [RARLAB](https://www.rarlab.com/) and order it. The generator can generate the license file. The generator is only for personal research (such as finite field arithmetic, elliptic curve cryptography) use. It's forbidden to use this for business purpose. In case of infringement, please contact the author to delete.

## 2. How to generate?

The generator is implemented purely in JavaScript and doesn't use any other libraries. So you can visit this website to generate online, or use the function ***Winrar_KeyGen(USER,LIC)*** in KeyGen.js.

## 3. License
The code is available under the MIT license.
